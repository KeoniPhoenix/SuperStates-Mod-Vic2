# Principles and Standards for the SuperStates Mod for Victoria II #

## Scope of Area ##

The scope of Area shall be in Australia, Oceania, North America, and South America.  And shall involve existing and nonexisting subnational entities of federal states in those areas: 
  * Argentina
  * Australia
  * Brazil
  * Canada
  * Federal Republic of Central America (Guatamala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica)
  * Federation of the West Indies
  * Mexico
  * Micronesia and the Pacific Trust Territories
  * Venezuela
  * United States

Also included will be released post-colonial nations within the scope of area to reduce the advantage of the Vanilla colonial powers.  Unitary nations like Chile (which is heavily influenced by the structure and political system of France) is to be restricted except where necessary.  Certain exceptions are New Zealand (invited to join Australia as a state), and parts of the Caribbean to remove vanilla nation's colonies.

## Nation Tags ##
*(country_tags.txt)*

The nation tags list should be kept as simple as possible to avoid overburdening the Vic2 engine and to make it easaier to debug.  Vanilla tags are to be used for nations being modded to help in debugging.  As tags in Vic2 must have multiple flags, duplicating nations with more than one tag for the purposes of flag changes is prohibited in Vic2.

## Upper House Reforms ##

It shall be standard that when certain formable nations are created that their Upper House shall be as equivalent to their real world counterpart as much as possible.  For example, that when the United States is formed, it shall have Two Seats per State in the Upper House.  And Canada shall have Appointed.  In most circumstances these reforms should be locked except for very specific means to change them.

Some nations have Upper House forms that are not represented, they will get the closest approximation that would apply.  

## Slavery ##

Slavery shall be enabled in areas historical to the era and, if applicable, in some of the post-colonial nations (such as Cuba and other slave Caribbean regions still existing in 1836).

Slavery shall be prohibited in the United States outside of the historical regions and the issue of slavery that was the subject of controversy for the lead up to the American Civil War, shall be handled by events that possibly but not likely legalizes slavery (regions this would apply to are Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, and Nebraska).

Slavery will be prohibited within all of Canada, Australia, Central American, and Oceania regions where it was historically banned before 1836.  Brazilian and Venezuelean regions will have slavery allowed as it was legal at the time.

## Provinces ##

The provinces map in SuperStates Mod for Vic2 shall match the provices used in SuperStates Mod for EU4 as closesly as possible, this is to keep the province neat and tidy but also to allow the creation of a EU4 to Vic2 converter within the Mod project. This means that a state/nation in the mod will have the same amount of provinces per state/nation in EU4 and Vic2.  This can be easily facilitated by proper transfer of provinces from the EU4 verison of provinces.bmp to the Vic2 version despite not having the exact same size provinces.

Province names shall work differently than in EU4.  Provinces in Vic2 shall be named by the principle city in the region the province is made up by.  This could result in different names being used than in EU4 as there are a few non-county seats that are considered the principle city in their region in the US.  As the province names is not dependent on county or county-equivalent names, this should result in a reduction in the number of Duplicated names. (Erie, PA and Erie, NY for examples in SuperStates Mod in EU4).

It is encouraged to use the principle city names but it is allowed to have events rename provinces to a different city name to accomplish some sort of abstraction that coincides with an event.  For instance, an event to utilize the Niagara Falls to generate electricity to become the economic center of the province Buffalo resides in, is acceptable to rename the province after Niagara Falls to signfy such an event.

## Mod Distribution ##

This mod will be available here and other locations to be determined.  As Victoria II requires manual installation, it is required players are able to understand how to install mods manually.  Support for problems with the mod for installation is at the discretion of the mod author, KeoniPhoenix, and is dependent on proving one has a copy of the game in their Steam Library.  This is a policy to reduce liability towards the publishers of Victoria II, Paradox Interactive.

## Mod Name ##

The names SuperStates and SuperStates Mod and any variants (i.e. "New SuperStates Mod") is retained by the mod author, KeoniPhoenix. If the mod is forked or modified into a new project, it must use a new name as to avoid issues with this mod project. If the issue is particularly egregious, official action may be taken.

Credit SuperStates Mod should be given when parts are used in other projects.
